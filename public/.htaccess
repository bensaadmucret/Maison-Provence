# Use the front controller as index file. It serves as a fallback solution when

# to each configured DirectoryIndex file (e.g. index.php, index.html, index.pl).

    # resolution of the index.php file and to redirect to the correct URI. It will
    # work in environments without path prefix as well, providing a safe, one-size
    # fits all solution. But as you do not need it in this case, you can comment
    # the following 2 lines to eliminate the overhead.
